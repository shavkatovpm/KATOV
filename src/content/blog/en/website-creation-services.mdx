Website creation services for businesses in Uzbekistan are becoming more in demand every year. But many entrepreneurs face the same questions: **How much does it cost to build a website? Why do prices vary so much? What's the difference between a cheap and an expensive website?**

In this article, we'll give clear answers to exactly these questions — based on KATOV's experience.

<GrowthChart />

> **Your potential customers are searching for you on Google right now.** But if you don't have a website, how will they find you? "We have Instagram," you say? But Google doesn't show your Instagram page first — it shows your competitor's website.

## What determines the price of a website?

The cost of a website is not a single number. It's shaped by several factors.

### The purpose of the website must be clear

The "just have a website" approach doesn't deliver results. Before development, you need to clearly define the main goal:

- Increase the flow of clients
- Automate business processes
- Build a digital platform

> **Without a clear goal, it's impossible to set the right budget or expectations.** That's why we start every project not with design or technology, but with defining a specific goal.

### What key business problems does a website solve?

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Finding clients depends only on connections and ads | A website becomes an independent client source that works for you |
| People don't take you seriously | A website presents your business as reliable and professional |
| You have to explain everything from scratch to every client | A website explains your services upfront — you only talk to ready clients |
| It's unclear which direction is profitable and which isn't | Through the website, you can see which channel or service delivers real results |
| Your business processes aren't organized | A website streamlines processes and simplifies operations |

> If you want to solve your business problems through a website: call [**+998&nbsp;33&nbsp;888&nbsp;01&nbsp;33**](tel:+998338880133) — we'll offer the best solution for you.

### What does the price depend on?

Think of building a website like constructing a building — each floor added increases the cost:

<div className="price-factors">

| Factor | Level | Simple → Complex |
|---|---|---|
| **Goal** | ●●●●● | Card → Platform |
| **Design** | ●●●●○ | Template → Premium |
| **Functional** | ●●●●○ | Static → CRM |
| **Pages** | ●●●○○ | 1–3 → Unlimited |
| **Integrations** | ●●●○○ | None → API |
| **SEO** | ●●○○○ | Basic → Maximum |
| **Content** | ●●○○○ | Self → Pro |
| **Support** | ●○○○○ | None → Ongoing |

</div>

> **Simple conclusion:** the bigger the goal — the more complex the site and the higher the price. But the right investment always pays for itself.

## Website types and prices

KATOV offers three core plans. Each is designed for a specific business need:

### Plan comparison

## Why do prices vary so much?

One company says "we'll build a site for $200," another says "$2,000." This is natural.

### Cheap vs. quality website: what's the difference?

| | **Cheap website ($100–200)** | **Quality website ($500+)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Foundation** | Ready-made template | Design tailored to business |
| **Speed** | 2–3 days | 7–30 days |
| **Result** | Just exists | Attracts clients |
| **SEO** | None or minimal | Optimized |
| **Support** | None | Available |
| **Growth** | Limited | Flexible |

> The question isn't about price. The real question is — **will the website pay for itself or not.**

## Let the numbers speak

| Statistic | Source |
|---|---|
| **97%** of people search for local businesses online | BrightLocal |
| **75%** of users judge a company's credibility by its website | Stanford Web Research |
| **53%** of mobile users leave a site that takes more than 3 seconds to load | Google |
| **88%** of online shoppers don't return after a bad experience | Sweor |

## Your answers to these questions should be ready before ordering a website:

1. **"Why do I need a website?"** — if there's no clear answer to this question, the website will be unclear too
2. **Who is the website for?** — who is your target audience: young people, business owners, quick decision-makers?
3. **Will the website work with advertising?** — many build the website first, then add ads. In reality, the website should be built for advertising
4. **Can it be changed later?** — without an admin panel, every small change requires contacting a specialist
5. **Who is responsible for results?** — just "we'll build you a website" isn't enough. What matters is whether results are part of the conversation

> **Tip:** Before ordering a website, ask yourself 1 question: "How many clients per month do I want to get through my website?" — this answer will define the direction of the entire project.

## Working with KATOV

At KATOV, a project goes through the following stages:

| Stage | What happens | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Consultation** | Understanding business and goals — free | 1 day |
| **2. Proposal** | Developing structure and solution | 2–5 days |
| **3. Design** | Approving the design concept | 2–5 days |
| **4. Development** | Coding | Project dependent |
| **5. Launch** | Deploying the website | 1 day |
| **6. Monitoring** | Tracking and improving results | Ongoing |

> If half of these stages are missing — the website will simply be "made," not "working."
