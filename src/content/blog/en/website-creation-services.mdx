Website creation services for businesses in Uzbekistan are becoming more in demand every year. But many entrepreneurs face the same questions: **How much does it cost to build a website? Why do prices vary so much? What's the difference between a cheap and an expensive website?**

In this article, we'll give clear answers to exactly these questions — based on KATOV's experience.

## What determines the price of a website?

The cost of a website is not a single number. It's shaped by several factors.

### The purpose of the website

The most common mistake is ordering a website "just to have one." The real question should be:

- Will the website bring in clients?
- Will it just provide information about the company?
- Or will it directly drive sales?

**If the purpose isn't clear, neither the price nor the result will be clear.** That's why KATOV starts every project by defining the goal.

### Number of pages and structure

A 1-page site and a 10-page site can't cost the same. Each page — homepage, services, about us, contact — requires separate design and work.

### Design type

- **Template design** — fast and affordable, but all sites look alike
- **Custom design** — tailored to your brand, but requires more time and budget

Many businesses start with a template. That's normal. What matters isn't how pretty the design is, but whether the website works.

### Technical features

These also affect the price:

- Admin panel
- Blog section
- Lead collection via forms
- Telegram bot or CRM integration
- Analytics and lead tracking system

Every additional feature means additional time and cost.

## Why do prices vary so much?

One company says "we'll build a site for $200," another says "$2,000." This is natural.

**A cheap website** is usually built on a ready-made template. It's done quickly, but may not attract clients.

**A more expensive website** is thought through for your business — aimed at your goals, audience, and results.

The question isn't about price. The real question is — **will the website pay for itself or not.**

## What you need to know before ordering a website

- **"Why do I need a website?"** — if there's no clear answer to this question, the website will be unclear too
- **Who is the website for?** — who is your target audience: young people, business owners, quick decision-makers?
- **Will the website work with advertising?** — many build the website first, then add ads. In reality, the website should be built for advertising
- **Can it be changed later?** — without an admin panel, every small change requires contacting a specialist
- **Who is responsible for results?** — just "we'll build you a website" isn't enough. What matters is whether results are part of the conversation

## Working with KATOV

At KATOV, a project goes through the following stages:

- **Understanding the business and goals** — through a free consultation
- **Developing a proposal and structure** — tailored to your needs
- **Approving the design concept**
- **Development and testing**
- **Launch**
- **Monitoring and improving results**

If half of these stages are missing — the website will simply be "made," not "working."

## Conclusion

The price of website creation should depend not on design or code — **but on results**. A good website understands the business, thinks about the client, and ultimately generates profit.

If a website is made just "to exist" — that's an **expense**. If it brings in clients — that's an **investment**.
